        <h1>Greetings Fellow Human!</h1> 
        <p>
        You have reached my personal website. 
        Here you can find my recent work and contact information as well as my 
        <a href='./contact'>CV</a>! Bellow you can find some information about me and
        technologies I have used in the past. Also head over to the <a href='./work.html'>work page</a>
        to find out what I've been up as well as intersting things I've been learning about!

        </p>
        <p>
        As you can probably tell, this website design looks very primitive. This is because
        I am a minimalist and I focus on what's important which in this case is the content.
        Although I like beautifully designed websites, 
        I also like to keep things simple 
        (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle'>KISS principle</a>). 
        This way I am certain that this website runs on every browser!
        <p>If you have any suggestions for improvement, please do send me an email and 
        I will certainly take it into consideration!</p>
        <p>This website is up on <a href='https://github.com/oliva20/'>Github</a>.
        Feel free to use it! 
        </p>
        <p>Live long and prosper! :) </p>
        <!-- TODO get the emoji for the live long and prosper. -->

        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hi! I'm Andre and I'm a Software Engineer based in Southampton, UK.
           I found a passion for programming back in 2015 and I haven't stopped building things
            since then! The thought of creating something from the ground up has always inspired me to keep learning and growing both professionally and individually. </p>
